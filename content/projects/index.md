# [CS 4501 (Reinforcement Learning) Class Project (December 2022)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13-xV5eMrv0K8_HMjxM3CT0ku6xVrYF30/view?usp=share_link)

*I worked with my classmates from Reinforcement Learning, Ami Falk and Yanjin Chen, to adapt an existing method for __black-box optimization of high-dimensional functions__ to the measles risk assessment problem. This method was called LA-MCTS (Latent Action Monte Carlo Tree Search), and we added the capability to optimize over problems with linear inequality constraints and improved the sampling mechanism within the algorithm by replacing it with the MCMC-based Dikin walk sampler.*

# [C4GC Symposium poster (July 2022)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hVcSqqAZ9JBWjdw5u-Xr-9vpgb0fJvbJ/view?usp=share_link)

*I worked with Prof. Anil Vullikanti at the University of Virginia Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative on __modeling measles outbreak risk in the state of Virginia__ arising from undervaccination. I developed a Python implementation of the gravity tSIR model, and investigated how the output of the model varies with respect to different parameterizations of the model in the state of Virginia.*

# [UVA Undergraduate Research Symposium poster (October 2021)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hz6EWWjNQuqXi9IsPSPoRQ1bkZK6imZu/view?usp=share_link)

*I worked with Prof. Prasanna Balachandran to develop a __statistical physics-based model__ utilizing the Eagar-Tsai model and Bayesian calibration for __determining good processing parameters__ in the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. We also propagated uncertainties through the model using the polynomial chaos method, and used this to develop intuitive graphics known as printmaps which summarize which regions of process space are likely to result in good quality products.*
