## Research experience

---

__Research Assistant, UVA Biocomplexity Institute__ <br>
*Mentor: Anil Vullikanti* <br>
*2022-2023*

- Worked with a multidisciplinary team to study measles outbreak dynamics in Virginia zipcodes.
- Integrated infection count and geospatial human mobility data through model calibration for scenario analysis.
- Implemented high-dimensional Bayesian optimization techniques in Python using PyTorch/BOTorch to identify counterfactual scenarios 100 times more severe compared to baseline estimates.
- Presented findings in a 10 minute talk at the 2022 Computing for Global Challenges (C4GC) student symposium.


__Research Assistant, Department of Materials Science and Engineering__ <br>
*Mentor: Prasanna Balachandran* <br>
*2020-2023*

- Created a computational framework for predicting quality in additive manufacturing processes based upon Bayesian calibration and surrogate modeling.
- Assisted in development of frontend web application in R Shiny.
- Optimized numerical model runtime (R and C++) using profiling, resulting in speedups of 300%.
- Presented at the 2021 Distinguished Undergraduate Hypersonics Symposium and published in ASME Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering.
