Hi, my name is Nick Wu. 

I'm a 4th-year undergraduate at the University of Virginia studying mathematics and computer science. I'm interested in mathematical modeling, statistics, and optimization. Please see my projects page for examples of some of the things I've worked on!

In my free time, I enjoy playing and listening to music; I play the saxophone in [UVA's Jazz Ensemble.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VESyseJabG4)
