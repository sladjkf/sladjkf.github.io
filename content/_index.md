Hi, my name is Nick Wu. 

I'm a 4th-year undergraduate at the University of Virginia studying mathematics and computer science. I'm interested in mathematical modeling, statistics, and optimization, and planning to enter graduate study in this area to further my education. Please see my projects page for examples of some of the things I've worked on!

During my time at UVA, I have been very fortunate to be mentored by [Prasanna Balachandran](https://engineering.virginia.edu/balachandran-group/team) and [Anil Vullikanti](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/person/anil-vullikanti).

In my free time, I enjoy playing and listening to music; I play the saxophone in [UVA's Jazz Ensemble.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VESyseJabG4). I also used to upload [music videos on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/sladjkf)
