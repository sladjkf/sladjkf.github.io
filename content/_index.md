Hi! 

My full name is **Nicholas Ruiyuan Wu.** Most people just call me **Nick.** Sometimes they call me *Nick Wu.*

I am a third-year PhD student at the [University of Maryland](https://maryland.edu/)'s [Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computation (AMSC) program.](https://amsc.umd.edu) Before that, I did my bachelor's at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/). There, I was very fortunate to be mentored by 
[Prasanna Balachandran](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/prasanna-balachandran)
and [Anil Vullikanti](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/person/anil-vullikanti).

As of now (Fall 2025), my interests are broadly in **stochastic modeling, simulation and optimization**. I am trying to learn about things like:
- **applied probability**: queues, epidemic models
- **stochastic optimization**: stochastic gradient estimation, gradient-based search, Bayesian optimization
- **simulation calibration**: Bayesian calibration of computer models
- **sequential decision-making**: MDPs, stochastic games, reinforcement learning

Some other things that I enjoy include
- Music (especially jazz and jazz-adjacent things). I played the saxophone in [UVA's Jazz Ensemble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VESyseJabG4). I also used to upload [music videos on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/sladjkf)
- Going to coffee shops [(here is my own list of cafes that I've visited)]({{<ref "misc/coffee.md">}})
- Bike commuting and public transit.
