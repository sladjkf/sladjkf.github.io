title: Coffee shop (and study spot) list
---

Vaguely inspired by Ariel Rubinstein's [Cafe Atlas](https://cafeatlas.org/), this is my attempt at listing my favorite cafes and study spots that I've visited. As a native of the DC-Maryland-Virginia region, that's where most of these cafes are going to be, but if I visit one that I particularly like in a different place I will add it to the list.

Not all of these are strictly cafes. Some are libraries, but I hope to provide a good list of places where you can sit and work on things for a while, or just get out of the house and exist for a bit.

*My criteria*: A mix of the quality of the coffee and the setting itself, as I go to coffee shops for both. The coffee definitely has to be good - I like to spend my weekend mornings enjoying a coffee and a pastry that someone else made for me, and to feel a sense of place as others around me also live their lives: sit, chat, read a book, work on their laptops, or grab their coffees and rush of to the next place. Some of the things I look for could be summarized by the now common term ["third place"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place). I usually do not like to go to chains (e.g Starbucks).

I enjoy spaces with lots of wood and warm lighting - ideally, I think I like to feel as if I'm sitting in someone's living room. I don't mind clean and modern environments either, but I think there is something particularly charming about older settings. In the end, though, I find myself rotating between all sorts of environments. 

The numerical ratings are sort of arbitrary; don't expect too much coherence between them. The name of each cafe links to the Google Maps page for that cafe.

## Maryland


### [Vigilante Coffee (Hyattsville)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zrfxB3CTHoUHsWt67)

**Rating**: 8/10

Delicious coffee. Good amount of seating in a vaguely-industrial feeling setting - a few metal tables. It does get a little bit cold when they turn the fans on, so bring a jacket. Very busy on Saturday mornings, so come early to get a seat. The bookstore next door (My Aunt's Dead Books) is also an excellent place to spend some time after sitting here.

### [Takoma Beverage Company](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T5XgB7GPjKed1TxX9)

**Rating**: 8/10

Wonderful food and coffee. Atmosphere is exactly what I'm looking for - wood and warmth. Seating can be quite limited, though; it's more amenable to being a brunch spot than it is a study spot. Bring a friend! In the evenings I hear they also serve wine, but I haven't been there for that yet.

### [Black Lion Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oJ7oGoSq4KAMNS48A)

**Rating**: 6/10

Alright coffee and food, not the best. The atmosphere is pleasant, but the WiFi shuts off after you've connected to it for a while, unfortunately. So, overall not the best place to spend a few hours for studying.

### [Kefa Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vAMK1UyRyUmv8Jtv7)

**Rating: 7/10**

Delicious coffee and friendly owner! It's a bit like stepping into the past. The decor feels like it hasn't been updated since the 90s, which I actually kind of dig, and there's cute odds and ends (local art) plastering the walls of the shop. A jazz playlist from IHeartRadio plays on a weak speaker, they have a $10 minimum for card purchases, and plenty of regulars come in to chat with the owner. You really feel that this shop is part of the community. No WiFi, come for the coffee and food (or bring physical books and paper instead).

### [Wheaton Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B4H3nrbJSrJEMdwv5)

**Rating: 8/10**

Talk about the kitchen sink, man. It's a library... and a rec center, and a cafe (actually a branch of the aforementioned Kefa Cafe), and a used bookstore. And there's an H-Mart up the street. Nice and quiet, large windows with lots of natural light. I think it sometimes gets busier after the local high schools let out, though.

### [Cuppa Tea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oPqVvaZUqp7Ymoeu5)

**Rating:** 7/10

*Visited: 10/11/2024*

A place that serves Hong Kong style milk tea (gasp.. not coffee??) I feel it's a pretty nice concept, sets it apart from the millions of other boba shops in the area. My understanding is that this style of milk tea is more commonly encountered in Asia, though. Ordered a standard Hong Kong milk tea, a bit on the pricey side but does definitely have a unique flavor. Interior has a nice design and plenty of character, but connecting to WiFi is a bit of a hassle. Seems like it's better just as a hangout spot with friends rather than for working. Try the egg waffles, very shareable and not too sweet. Also open late.

### [Shop Made in MD](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9cn2Ty4qNNNX63L69)

**Rating: 6.5/10**

*Visited: 10/13/2024*

A shop showcasing products and goodies from local vendors and craftspeople. Actually have been here a few times before during the summer, was pretty quiet then.  The vibe was... not personally my cup of tea... or coffee? (See the review of Second Nature Coffee below, under [Northern Virginia](#northern-virginia) - a slightly different kind of kitsch, though). I ordered a cortado and a bagel. Both were perfectly fine, not outstanding but good (although not entirely sure if my cortado tasting game is on point). You'll find mostly UMD students (and their parents coming to visit them) working here on a weekend, it seems.  Overall, I'd go to Vigilante Hyattsville any day over this; but its main draw seems to be the proximity to UMD's campus.


## DC

### [Portrait Gallery Courtyard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1bwQNQ7kS9A9bTu6)

**Rating**: 9/10

Okay, this place is amazing. But don't come here to work - come here to browse the art museum and stare up at the clouds while lying on a stone bench, and listen to the conversations happening near you, and contemplate what you're doing with your life. Seating for the cafe is pretty hard to get since it's a popular spot. I haven't tried the cafe itself but I don't expect it to be much good.

### [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/igJsWAwDLCDq8Tmt8)

**Rating**: 7/10

It's a pretty decent place to sit for a while and work - and there is a cafe inside! Unfortunately, it doesn't quite tick the architectural boxes I'm looking for (i.e the "Grand Room" is a tad underwhemling), although it is perfectly peaceful and there is plenty of seating with ample natural light. Conveniently accessed via the Green Line from College Park, so not a bad place to spend a Saturday. Has pretty stiff competition since the Portrait Gallery is right across the street from it, though.


### [Capitol One Cafe (Chinatown D.C.)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uChg73Ymidc7ku8s5)

*Visited: 10/13/2024*

**Rating**: 5.5/10

Okay, slightly breaking the "No Chains" rule for this one, but I'd been curious about this place for a while and decided to try the Chinatown location. Perfectly fine place to work. They have greeters/promoters who chat with you as you walk in the door; struck up a conversation with one and he pulled some strings to get me a free coffee! That's pretty cool. The coffee is served by Verve, which I understand is a West Coast brand. However, Google reviewers seem to look unfavorably upon this particular instantiation, deeming it unworthy of that name. I don't know about all that - I got a free drip coffee (perfectly drinkable), so life is pretty good. You have to ask the security guard to be let into the bathroom, which I guess makes sense in D.C. sometimes. Lower rating on principle (since it's honestly not that far above a Starbucks, all things considered).

### [Tynan Coffee and Tea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fQpRExM7CrDcMQYK9)

*Visited: 10/27/2024*

**Rating**: 6.5/10

Ordered a cortado and a turkey sandwich. Cortado was served nice and hot, but not much texture to the milk: "good but not great." Environment is perfectly fine, decor is a little rough around the edges but overall fine - I appreciate the slightly worn-looking wood tables and the high ceiling in the entranceway. No WiFi on the weekends, so if you want to work there download everything beforehand or bring paper copies. Overall, perfectly serviceable, but I'd say that I've had better in terms of both coffee and environment. Convenient to the Green Line via the Columbia Heights station.

## Northern Virginia

### [Cafein](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DkasuMzya5ev8EzZ9)

**Rating:** 8/10

*Visited*: 09/22/2024

A nice balance of woody warmth and clean modern looks. Breakfast sandwiches and coffee are all pretty good. A lively spot on weekends; full tables get taken up by families looking to spend their morning here, but I saw plenty of people camping out with their laptops too (like me). Korean coffee decor on a display shelf near the counter (makes sense for Chantilly).

### [Second Nature Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u7qw6KuB7To8hneZA)


**Rating**: 6.5/10

*Visited*: 09/23/2024

Leesburg locals will know that this place used to be called King St. Coffee and was an absolute Leesburg institution. Now it's back under a different name, but I still don't like the coffee that much. The place has been renovated and cleaned up, and overall I enjoy the wood and the warmth but it still has a certain "Live Laugh Love" kitsch that I'm not 100% on board with. (Actually, I think most of Downtown Leesburg has a bit of that kitsch, but it's alright...)

### [Paris Baguette (Herndon)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uNvcp5QqFBarhfn57)

**Rating**: 6.5/10

*Visited*: 10/05/2024

First time at a Paris Baguette. Pretty solid, honestly; can't complain too much. Lots of seating and natural light, clean and well furnished. Definitely nice for sitting for a while and working. However, the food and coffee aren't exceptional. Coffee was definitely subpar. Also had a pain au chocolat, which wasn't bad. Seems like places that do food and drink are usually better at one of the two, and given the name of this chain it seems to be the pastries. Would return though (since the ambiance is fairly nice).

### [De Clieu Coffee and Sandwiches - Legato](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BK7AQNNaZtd76jMB8)

**Rating**: 8.5/10

*Visited*: 10/06/2024

Quite good. Wasn't sure what to expect, but as soon as I took a look at the menu I realized they take coffee pretty seriously. Ordered a pourover (not often that you see that, I feel) and a BLT (small but taste was pretty good). Open space, lots of seating, and friendly staff. Definitely will come back if I'm in the area.
