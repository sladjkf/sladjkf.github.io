title: Coffee shop (and study spot) list
---

Vaguely inspired by Ariel Rubinstein's [Cafe Atlas](https://cafeatlas.org/), this is my attempt at listing my favorite cafes and study spots that I've visited. As a native of the DC-Maryland-Virginia region, that's where most of these cafes are going to be, but if I visit one that I particularly like in a different place I will add it to the list.

Not all of these are strictly cafes. Some are libraries, but I hope to provide a good list of places where you can sit and work on things for a while, or just get out of the house and exist for a bit.

*My criteria*: A mix of the quality of the coffee and the setting itself, as I go to coffee shops for both. The coffee definitely has to be good - I like to spend my weekend mornings enjoying a coffee and a pastry that someone else made for me, and to feel a sense of place as others around me also live their lives: sit, chat, read a book, work on their laptops, or grab their coffees and rush of to the next place. Some of the things I look for could be summarized by the now common term ["third place"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place). I usually do not like to go to chains (e.g Starbucks).

I enjoy spaces with lots of wood and warm lighting - ideally, I think I like to feel as if I'm sitting in someone's living room. I don't mind clean and modern environments either, but I think there is something particularly charming about older settings. In the end, though, I find myself rotating between all sorts of environments. 

The numerical ratings are sort of arbitrary; don't expect too much coherence between them. The name of each cafe links to the Google Maps page for that cafe.

## Maryland

### [Vigilante Coffee (Hyattsville)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zrfxB3CTHoUHsWt67)

**Rating**: 8/10

Delicious coffee. Good amount of seating in a vaguely-industrial feeling setting - a few metal tables. It does get a little bit cold when they turn the fans on, so bring a jacket. Very busy on Saturday mornings, so come early to get a seat. The bookstore next door (My Aunt's Dead Books) is also an excellent place to spend some time after sitting here.

### [Takoma Beverage Company](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T5XgB7GPjKed1TxX9)

**Rating**: 8/10

Wonderful food and coffee. Atmosphere is exactly what I'm looking for - wood and warmth. Seating can be quite limited, though; it's more amenable to being a brunch spot than it is a study spot. Bring a friend! In the evenings I hear they also serve wine, but I haven't been there for that yet.

### [Black Lion Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oJ7oGoSq4KAMNS48A)

**Rating**: 6/10

Alright coffee and food, not the best. The atmosphere is pleasant, but the WiFi shuts off after you've connected to it for a while, unfortunately. So, overall not the best place to spend a few hours for studying.

### [Kefa Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vAMK1UyRyUmv8Jtv7)

**Rating: 7/10**

Delicious coffee and friendly owner! It's a bit like stepping into the past. The decor feels like it hasn't been updated since the 90s, which I actually kind of dig, and there's cute odds and ends (local art) plastering the walls of the shop. A jazz playlist from IHeartRadio plays on a weak speaker, they have a $10 minimum for card purchases, and plenty of regulars come in to chat with the owner. You really feel that this shop is part of the community. No WiFi, come for the coffee and food (or bring physical books and paper instead).

## DC

### [Portrait Gallery Courtyard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1bwQNQ7kS9A9bTu6)

**Rating**: 9/10

Okay, this place is amazing. But don't come here to work - come here to browse the art museum and stare up at the clouds while lying on a stone bench, and listen to the conversations happening near you, and contemplate what you're doing with your life. Seating for the cafe is pretty hard to get since it's a popular spot. I haven't tried the cafe itself but I don't expect it to be much good.


## Northern Virginia

### [Cafein](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DkasuMzya5ev8EzZ9)

**Rating:** 8/10

A nice balance of woody warmth and clean modern looks. Breakfast sandwiches and coffee are all pretty good. A lively spot on weekends; full tables get taken up by families looking to spend their morning here, but I saw plenty of people camping out with their laptops too (like me). Korean coffee decor on a display shelf near the counter (makes sense for Chantilly).

### [Second Nature Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u7qw6KuB7To8hneZA)

**Rating**: 6.5/10

Leesburg locals will know that this place used to be called King St. Coffee and was an absolute Leesburg institution. Now it's back under a different name, but I still don't like the coffee that much. The place has been renovated and cleaned up, and overall I enjoy the wood and the warmth but it still has a certain "Live Laugh Love" kitsch that I'm not 100% on board with. (Actually, I think most of Downtown Leesburg has a bit of that kitsch, but it's alright...)

### [Paris Baguette (Herndon)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uNvcp5QqFBarhfn57)

**Rating**: 6.5/10

*Visited*: 10/05/2024

First time at a Paris Baguette. Pretty solid, honestly; can't complain too much. Lots of seating and natural light, clean and well furnished. Definitely nice for sitting for a while and working. However, the food and coffee aren't exceptional. Coffee was definitely subpar. Also had a pain au chocolat, which wasn't bad. Seems like places that do food and drink are usually better at one of the two, and given the name of this chain it seems to be the pastries. Would return though (since the ambiance is fairly nice).

### [De Clieu Coffee and Sandwiches - Legato](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BK7AQNNaZtd76jMB8)

**Rating**: 8.5/10

*Visited*: 10/06/2024

Quite good. Wasn't sure what to expect, but as soon as I took a look at the menu I realized they take coffee pretty seriously. Ordered a pourover (not often that you see that, I feel) and a BLT (small but taste was pretty good). Open space, lots of seating, and friendly staff. Definitely will come back if I'm in the area.
